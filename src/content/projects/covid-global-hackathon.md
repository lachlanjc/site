After lockdown, Facebook, TikTok, Microsoft, AWS, & others began [organizing](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111707674548151) the COVID-19 Global Hackathon, which had Hack Club as the student partner. Working with Facebook’s Communications team, I made the recap website, which got 26k unique visitors & 69k pageviews its first week.

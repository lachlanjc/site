I made a visualization of the gun lobby’s $40M+ funding of the U.S. Congress, which I presented in the [NYU Winter 2019 Show for the Recently Possible](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2019/). Using data from the [Center for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/) & Next.js, the site lets you find your representative, explore by state, & see the bias in funding.

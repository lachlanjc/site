As part of the Summer of Making, I built the Hack Club Scrapbook website, a public, Slack-powered social network for posting what you’re working on. During the summer, over 400 students made 6,000 posts, & this winter it hit nearly **4k users with 10k posts**. It’s a fully static Next.js site, powered by Airtable (which [I wrote about](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-07-30_how_scrapbook_works/), & a [Mux case study](https://mux.com/case-studies/hackclub/)).

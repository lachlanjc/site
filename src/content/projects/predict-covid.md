[Zach Latta](https://zachlatta.com) & I had the idea of making an **interactive visualization of COVID** based on plotting [countries’ relative paths](https://twitter.com/MarkJHandley/status/1237119688578138112). (When we launched, on March 18, the U.S. was 10 days behind Italy’s outbreak.) It was the first-ever [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com) app [in production](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-03-20_building_predict_covid_with_redwood/) & featured by the [GitHub blog](https://github.blog/2020-03-23-open-collaboration-on-covid-19/#data-visualization). I stopped updating it in the summer after the U.S. made the visualization irrelevant. I also published [testing.predictcovid.com](https://testing.predictcovid.com) to visualize testing, featured on the [Vercel blog](https://vercel.com/blog/we-are-all-in-this-together).

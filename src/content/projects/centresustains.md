Working with [Pam Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-adams-0ba92611), my local government’s Sustainability Planner, I designed & built this website for Centre Sustains, my town’s public outreach effort for climate planning & sustainability legislation. I’m especially proud of the [page explaining how climate change impacts our area](https://centresustains.com/climate).
